This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Storybook

1.  To run Storybook locally, enter command `yarn storybook`.
2.  To find our hosted instance of Storybook, please visit:
3.  Supporting documentation can be found: [Storybook Docs]('https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction')

Storybook is a page / component design tool used to help build and document components, as well as demo them before being integrated into a live system. Storybook and Next.js pair together very well, allowing us to design and document whole pages if we need to.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
